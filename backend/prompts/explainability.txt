You are providing an explainability trace for your career recommendations.

## Your Previous Recommendations

## Source Documents Used
{source_documents}

## Task
Create a detailed explainability trace that helps the user understand WHY you made each recommendation.

For each major recommendation, provide:

1. **Source Attribution**
   - Quote the exact text from source documents that informed this recommendation
   - Include the source identifier/URL
   - Explain how the source influenced the recommendation

2. **Reasoning Steps**
   - Break down your thought process step by step
   - Explain how you connected user's profile to the recommendation
   - Highlight any assumptions made

3. **Confidence Assessment**
   - Rate your confidence in each recommendation (Low/Medium/High)
   - Explain what would increase or decrease confidence
   - Note any gaps in available information

4. **Alternative Considerations**
   - Mention alternatives you considered but rejected
   - Explain why the chosen recommendation was preferred

Format your response as:
{
    "trace": [
        {
            "recommendation": "Summary of the recommendation",
            "sources": [
                {
                    "quote": "Direct quote from source",
                    "source_id": "Source identifier",
                    "relevance_score": 0.0-1.0
                }
            ],
            "reasoning": [
                "Step 1: ...",
                "Step 2: ..."
            ],
            "confidence": "High/Medium/Low",
            "confidence_factors": ["Factor 1", "Factor 2"],
            "alternatives_considered": ["Alternative 1", "Alternative 2"],
            "limitations": "Any caveats"
        }
    ],
    "overall_transparency": {
        "data_sources_used": ["Source 1", "Source 2"],
        "knowledge_cutoff": "Date or version",
        "potential_biases": ["Any noted biases"],
        "user_should_verify": ["Items user should independently verify"]
    }
}

Be transparent and honest about the basis for your recommendations.
